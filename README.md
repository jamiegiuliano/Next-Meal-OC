# Next Meal OC

## About

> Next Meal OC is an easy-to-use resource for Orange County residents experiencing homelessness and hunger.  This resource takes the work out of food access and allows users to find food in a pinch as well as supplement meals and save toward housing and other necessary expenses.  

## Back Story

> While working at an emergency homeless shelter for families in Orange County, I found that food access resources were available, but the tools for searching for them proved to be difficult to use for the people who would benefit from them.  I found that rather than going out to find free meals, families would spend their last money on fast food and run out of money they needed for other expenses and building savings.  This resource is meant to be a small step toward helping people who are struggling find their way back to housing and financial security.

## How You Can Help

> I have found that people generally want to help their communities but aren't sure how.  Letting people in need know about this resource is one way you can make a difference.  Another great resource is 211OC, where people can find shelter information as well as a wealth of other resources.
